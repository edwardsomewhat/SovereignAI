# Sovereign Training Pipeline

Run the training data curation pipeline: `/home/fated/training_pipeline.py`.

## Directory Layout

```
~/.hermes/training_data/
├── pipeline_state.json    # Tracks last session timestamp
├── raw/                   # Stage 1: extracted session transcripts (*.md)
├── processed/             # Stage 2: LLM summaries (*.txt)
└── curated/               # Stage 3: A/B-graded final training data (*.txt)
```

Sessions live in `~/.hermes/sessions/session_*.json`.

## Running

### Single stage
```bash
cd /home/fated
./.hermes/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python training_pipeline.py {capture|summarize|grade}
```

### All stages (full run)
```bash
cd /home/fated
./.hermes/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python training_pipeline.py all
```

**⚠️ Always run in background mode.** The pipeline makes one LLM call per session (Ollama at `http://100.84.92.74:11434`, model `qwen3.5:9b`). With 100+ sessions, foreground mode will time out at 600s. Use:

```bash
terminal(command="... training_pipeline.py all", background=true, notify_on_complete=true, timeout=1800)
```

Then poll with `process(action="poll", session_id="...")` or watch file counts:
```bash
ls ~/.hermes/training_data/processed/*.txt | wc -l   # growing = summarize stage
ls ~/.hermes/training_data/curated/*.txt | wc -l     # growing = grade stage
```

## Known Bug: Re-summarization Loop

`stage_summarize()` checks `processed/{stem}.txt` to skip already-summarized sessions. But `stage_grade()` **deletes** processed files after grading (A/B → moves to curated; C/D → deleted). On the next run, summarize re-processes ALL raw files — including the 90%+ that were already graded A/B. This wastes ~100+ LLM calls per run.

### Fix
In `stage_summarize()`, add a curated-path skip before the LLM call:

```python
# In stage_summarize(), inside the for-loop, after the processed check:
curated_file = CURATED_DIR / f"{rf.stem}.txt"
if curated_file.exists():
    continue
```

This prevents re-summarizing sessions that were already graded and kept in previous runs.
See `references/re-summarization-bug.md` for full root-cause analysis and reproduction.

## LLM Details

- Endpoint: `http://100.84.92.74:11434` (configurable via `TRAINING_LLM_URL` env var)
- Model: `qwen3.5:9b` (configurable via `TRAINING_LLM_MODEL`)
- Timeout: 120s per call (set in `call_ollama()`)
- Summarize prompt: ~200-400 tokens in → ~100 tokens out (5-field template)
- Grade prompt: ~100 tokens in → ~1 token out (single letter)
- Performance: ~10-30s per summarize, ~1-3s per grade on the 9B model

## Grading Rubric

| Grade | Action | Criteria |
|-------|--------|----------|
| A     | Keep   | User correction + agent adapts. Novel problem solved. Architecture decision. |
| B     | Keep   | Multi-turn reasoning chain with tool calls that succeeded. Non-trivial workflow. |
| C     | Discard | Mechanical success. File reads, simple queries. Single tool calls. |
| D     | Discard | Failures, dead ends, agent spinning with no resolution. |
